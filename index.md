Automated driving is being developed and deployed in complex road traffic environments with dense interactions. Ensuring safe and comfortable operation requires adaptable solutions — from reliance solely on onboard sensors and computing to integration with intelligent infrastructure, connectivity, and remote operation. As vehicles become increasingly intelligent, maintaining their efficiency and safety throughout their operational lifetime is essential for preventing accidents and fostering public trust.

This workshop explores three critical topics:
1. Multi-road user interactions and behavior prediction/planning
1. AI trustworthiness and CCAM user perception
1. Remote operation of intelligent connected and automated vehicles

This full-day workshop includes three sessions focused on these topics, complemented by two interactive poster sessions. Each session will open with a keynote speaker, followed by workshop paper presentations. The workshop then concludes with a round table discussion featuring experts from diverse backgrounds, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all main topics.

Firstly, technological and human factor challenges on remote operation covering three aspects—monitoring, assistance, and driving—will be discussed.

Then the discussion will be focused on aligning AI-based systems' trustworthiness across technical, ethical, and social dimensions. It will explore how to develop CCAM systems that are not only technically robust and reliable but also perceived as trustworthy by users. This includes addressing challenges in human-machine interaction, transparency, and ethical considerations.

The last session presents work examining the balance between safety and efficient behavior in automated vehicles, discussing approaches to predict and plan comfortable trajectories that meet human expectations while maintaining safety. The workshop will focus on multi-modal approaches and their evaluation, considering the diversity of valid solutions of a traffic situation and facing unknown intentions of others.

By combining these topics, the workshop provides a comprehensive view of automated driving challenges, emphasising the crucial roles of remote operation supported by humans, and AI in developing trustworthy, efficient, and safe automated mobility solutions.

| 9:10&rarr;9:30   | Learning from Disengagements: An Analysis of Safety Driver Interventions during Remote Driving <br> _Ole Hans, Jürgen Adamy_ <br> <details> **Abstract**: This study investigates disengagements of Remote Driving Systems (RDS) based on interventions by an in-vehicle Safety Drivers (SD) in real-world Operational Design Domains (ODD) with a focus on Remote Driver (RD) performance during their driving training. Based on an analysis of over 14,000 km on remote driving data, the relationship between the driving experience of 25 RD and the frequency of disengagements is systematically investigated. The results show that the number of SD interventions decreases significantly within the first 400 km of driving experience, which illustrates a clear learning curve of the RD. In addition, the most common causes for 183 disengagements analyzed are identified and categorized, whereby four main scenarios for SD interventions were identified and illustrated. The results emphasize the need for experience-based and targeted training programs aimed at developing basic driving skills early on, thereby increasing the safety, controllability and efficiency of RDS, especially in complex urban environment ODDs. </details>|
| 9:30&rarr;9:50   | Control Center Framework for Teleoperation Support of Automated Vehicles on Public Roads <br> _Maria Wolf, Niklas Krauss, Arwed Schmidt, Frank Diermeyer_ <br> <details> **Abstract**: Implementing a teleoperation system with its various actors and interactions is challenging and requires an overview of the necessary functions. This work collects all tasks that arise in a control center for an automated vehicle fleet from literature and assigns them to the two roles Remote Operator and Fleet Manager. Focusing on the drivingrelated tasks of the remote operator, a process is derived that contains the sequence of tasks, associated vehicle states, and transitions between the states. The resulting state diagram shows all remote operator actions available to effectively resolve automated vehicle disengagements. Thus, the state diagram can be applied to existing legislation or modified based on prohibitions of specific interactions. The developed control center framework and included state diagram should serve as a basis for implementing and testing remote support for automated vehicles to be validated on public roads. </details>|
| 9:50&rarr;10:10  | Regulating Teleoperation on Public Roads: Key Takeaways from an Expert Workshop <br> _Bengt Escher, Jonas Herde, Florian Nikolai, Andreas Riener_ <details> **Abstract**:  Teleoperation is considered an interim solution for the introduction of automated vehicles in public transport. It describes the possibility for a remote driver to take control of the vehicle if there are uncertainties regarding the current driving situation. Despite the efforts of researchers and legislators and the obvious advantages of the technology, explicit regulations for teleoperation are still pending. One reason for this is the absence of clarity regarding which aspects need to be regulated and in what form. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of different categories and specifications that need to be defined to support the derivation of legal requirements. For this purpose, we conducted a workshop in Germany with experts from various disciplines who have been involved in the integration of automated driving for many years. Based on insights from the fields of law, technology, human factors, and licensing authorities, a list of the requirements was developed. By presenting a holistic approach, the results should help to develop a common consensus on the scope of the regulations and to define clear threshold values. </details>|
